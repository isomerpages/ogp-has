# Isomer Website Building Experience

## Frustrations with Isomer

Today, building on Isomer can be a bit frustrating due to the following reasons:

### Accidental Exit from Site Editor

- I personally have accidentally pressed "Back to My Sites" more than a few times, which exits the site editor.
- This inconsistency occurs when navigating between My Workspace and other sections.
- The top panel changes for root level items and ungrouped pages, where you press "Back" to go back.
- However, for folders, breadcrumbs are shown instead, leading to accidental clicks on "Back to My Sites."

### Unfinished UI of the Block Editor

- The UI of the block editor on the homepage feels unfinished, lacking a polished appearance.

### Difficulty with HTML and Markdown

- Many users struggle with using HTML and Markdown when building out pages on Isomer.

### Excessive Customization by Advanced Users

- Some advanced users tend to customize the site excessively, causing issues during the website's construction.

### Poor Execution of Information Architecture

- Although efforts have been made to enforce good information architecture, the execution has not been successful.
- Naming inconsistencies, such as using different titles like "About Us," "The OGP Experience," or "What We Do," make interpretation difficult.

## Isomer's Aim: Delightful Website-Building Experience

Isomer strives to provide a delightful website-building experience for non-technical individuals, offering the following benefits:

### Pros

- Polished CMS UI
- Anyone can build great websites without needing to know or care about HTML, CSS, or Markdown.
- WYSIWYG block editor eliminates the need for HTML or Markdown.
- Users are prevented from encountering HTML/Markdown-related issues.

### Cons

- Loss of customizability and control over site elements (a trade-off that comes with the convenience).
- Inability to build spaceships (just a playful limitation).

## Enforcing Great Website Building Practices

Isomer also aims to enforce great website building practices implicitly, ensuring users adhere to best practices:

- Implementation of "Pro tips" into the build experience in an implicit manner.
- An example of this is limiting navigation levels to a maximum of three, discouraging workarounds.
- Imposing a hard limit on the number of items in the navigation bar.
- Validating the entire site against predefined rules and listing all issues.
- Users must acknowledge the issues before making pull requests.
- Easy rectification of issues by providing clear guidance on how to fix them.

## The Path to a Better Isomer

To achieve a better website-building experience on Isomer, the following improvements are planned:

- Introduce a truly WYSIWYG experience, eliminating the need for HTML or Markdown.
- Implement a general block editing feature for every page.
- Enhance the performance of previews, ensuring they are snappy and accurate.
- Conduct a major update to templates and introduce a wider variety of templates.
- Add components that enhance both the build experience and the overall site experience, such as cards.

## Exciting Future: Content Validation

In the future, Isomer aims to introduce content validation by abstracting the content away from HTML and Markdown syntax. This will enable easier application of content validation, similar to the functionality provided by [Hemingway App](https://hemingwayapp.com/).
